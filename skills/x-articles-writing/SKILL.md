# X Articles Writing

Transform Chinese content into polished, native English articles for X's long-form format.

## Core Principle

**Write English that sounds native, not translated.**

The goal is content that reads as if originally conceived and written in English by a native speaker—natural idioms, proper collocations, and culturally appropriate expressions.

## Translation Workflow

```text
Chinese Input → Meaning Extraction → Native English Reconstruction → Polish & Format
```

### Step 1: Meaning Extraction

Extract the core meaning, intent, and tone—not the literal words:

- What is the author trying to communicate?
- What emotion or reaction should this evoke?
- What's the cultural context that may need adaptation?

### Step 2: Native Reconstruction

Rebuild the content in natural English:

- Use English thought patterns, not Chinese syntax
- Choose idioms native speakers actually use
- Adapt cultural references when needed

### Step 3: Polish for X

Optimize for X's article format:

- Strong, engaging opening hook
- Scannable structure with clear sections
- Punchy conclusions that invite engagement

## Translation Patterns

### Avoid Chinglish Patterns

| Chinese Pattern | ❌ Literal                    | ✅ Native                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 我认为...       | I think that...              | [直接陈述观点]                         |
| 众所周知        | As we all know               | It's well established that / Clearly  |
| 在...方面       | In the aspect of...          | When it comes to / For / Regarding    |
| 进行了讨论      | Carried out a discussion     | Discussed                             |
| 取得了成功      | Obtained success             | Succeeded                             |
| 具有重要意义    | Has important significance   | Matters / Is significant              |
| 不断地          | Unceasingly                  | Continuously / Steadily / Kept -ing   |

### Sentence Structure

**Chinese tends toward**: Long, nested clauses → Break into shorter English sentences

```text
❌ "Due to the fact that the technology has developed rapidly in recent years,
    many companies have started to adopt AI solutions."

✅ "AI adoption has surged. Rapid technological advances made it inevitable."
```

### Collocation Fixes

| ❌ Wrong               | ✅ Natural                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| improve the efficiency | boost efficiency                     |
| solve the problem      | fix the issue / address the problem  |
| do research            | conduct research                     |
| make progress          | progress / advance                   |
| very delicious         | delicious / incredible               |
| open your horizon      | broaden your horizons                |

### Tone Calibration

For general X audience, aim for:

- **Confident but not arrogant** — State opinions directly
- **Conversational but informed** — Accessible yet substantive
- **Engaging but not clickbait** — Hook readers authentically

## X Article Structure

### Opening (Hook)

Start with impact—no throat-clearing:

```text
❌ "In this article, I would like to share some thoughts about..."
❌ "As we all know, AI is developing very fast..."

✅ "Most AI advice is wrong. Here's what actually works."
✅ "I spent 6 months building this. Here's what broke."
```

### Body

Use clear structure:

- **Numbered lists** for sequential points
- **Bold key phrases** for scannability
- **Short paragraphs** (2-3 sentences max)
- **Subheadings** for longer pieces

### Closing

End with resonance:

- Callback to opening theme
- Clear takeaway or call-to-action
- Invitation for discussion (not "please like and subscribe")

## Quick Reference

### Words to Avoid

| Overused             | Alternatives               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| very                 | [use stronger adjective]   |
| really               | [often deletable]          |
| actually             | [often deletable]          |
| basically            | [often deletable]          |
| I think              | [just state the opinion]   |
| in order to          | to                         |
| due to the fact that | because                    |
| at this point in time | now                       |

### Power Verbs

Replace weak verbs with precise ones:

| Weak | Strong Options                    |
| ---- | --------------------------------- |
| make | create, build, craft, forge       |
| do   | execute, perform, accomplish      |
| get  | obtain, acquire, secure, land     |
| use  | leverage, employ, utilize, apply  |
| show | demonstrate, reveal, illustrate   |
| help | enable, empower, support          |

## Output Format

When translating, provide:

1. **English Article** — The polished, publication-ready translation
2. **Key Adaptations** (optional) — Brief notes on significant changes from literal meaning, only if the adaptation is substantial

**Remember**: The best translation doesn't feel like a translation.
