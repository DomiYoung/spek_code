🚀 EXPLORE, PLAN, CODE, TEST WORKFLOW
================================================================================

TASK: $@

================================================================================
📋 PHASE 1: EXPLORE
================================================================================

I will now use parallel Task agents to:

□ Find all relevant files for the implementation
□ Identify similar patterns in the codebase
□ Understand the current architecture
□ Gather examples and edit targets

Key areas to explore:
- Core implementation files
- Test files and patterns
- Configuration files
- Documentation
- Related features

================================================================================
📝 PHASE 2: PLAN
================================================================================

Based on exploration, I will create a detailed implementation plan:

1. OBJECTIVE
   - Clear description of what needs to be done
   - Success criteria

2. TECHNICAL APPROACH
   - Architecture decisions
   - Technology choices
   - Design patterns to follow

3. FILES TO MODIFY/CREATE
   - List each file with specific changes
   - New files needed

4. TESTING STRATEGY
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Manual testing checklist

5. DOCUMENTATION
   - Code documentation
   - User documentation
   - API documentation

6. QUESTIONS/UNCERTAINTIES
   - Areas needing clarification
   - Assumptions being made

================================================================================
💻 PHASE 3: CODE
================================================================================

Implementation checklist:

□ Follow existing code style and patterns
□ Use clear, descriptive names
□ Implement in logical order
□ Regular commits with clear messages
□ Run formatters and linters

Code quality checks:
- ESLint/Prettier (for JS/TS)
- Black/isort (for Python)
- rustfmt (for Rust)
- gofmt (for Go)

================================================================================
✅ PHASE 4: TEST
================================================================================

Testing checklist:

AUTOMATED TESTS:
□ All unit tests pass
□ All integration tests pass
□ New tests added for new functionality
□ Coverage meets project standards

MANUAL TESTING:
□ Feature works as expected
□ Edge cases handled
□ Error states handled gracefully
□ Performance is acceptable
□ No regressions introduced

UI/UX TESTING (if applicable):
□ Visual appearance correct
□ Responsive design works
□ Accessibility maintained
□ Cross-browser compatibility

================================================================================
📄 PHASE 5: WRITE UP
================================================================================
